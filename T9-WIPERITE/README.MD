## 💡 Overview

**WipeRite** is an autonomous whiteboard robot that **writes and erases** notes automatically.  
It magnetically mounts to any standard whiteboard, maps the surface, and performs precise writing and erasing operations.

> Designed for educators, presenters, and workplaces to automate repetitive whiteboard tasks and improve focus during lessons.
